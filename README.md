# mrc-image-converter
A jupyter notebook for converting mrc files to other image file types. While not the main functionality, it can also convert between supported image file types.

This notebook supports the following filetypes:
  - Input: png, jpg, tiff, mrc
  - Output: png, jpg, tiff

All variables are retrieved from user input unless otherwise stated, so it's best to run this in JupyterHub. Upload the file you want to convert to your JupyterHub before running the code, otherwise, Jupyter will not be able to find your file.

You can also run this in Google Colab with full interactivity support here:
