# mrc-image-converter
A jupyter notebook for converting mrc files to other image file types. While not the main functionality, it can also convert between supported image file types.

This notebook supports the following file types:
  - Input: png, jpg, tiff, mrc
  - Output: png, jpg, tiff

All variables are retrieved from user input unless otherwise stated, so it's best to run this in JupyterHub. Upload the file you want to convert to your JupyterHub before running the code, otherwise, Jupyter will not be able to it.

When converting mrc files, it may be useful to visualize the original file in napari if you want the file to save as it is displayed in napari.

You can also run this in Google Colab with full interactivity support here:
